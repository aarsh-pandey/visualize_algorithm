## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To work with this repository, you just need to clone it to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aarshcode/visualize_algorithm.git
```

This project works with Python 3.* , to install depencencies just execute
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or you can also install required packages separately by executing
```
$ pip install jupyterlab
$ pip install numpy 
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install seaborn
```
if pip doesn't work for you, just try `pip3` instead of `pip`

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

All **Developer** know the importance of Time and Space complexity analysis of **Algorithms**,
but visualising algorithm is little hard for beginners.

I have created a simple visualization of some popular algorithms using **python3**

Hope this will Help.
